@deftypefun {void} {asn1_perror} (asn1_retCode @var{error})
@var{error}: is an error returned by a libtasn1 function.

Prints a string to stderr with a description of an error.  This
function is like @code{perror()}.  The only difference is that it accepts
an error returned by a libtasn1 function.

This function replaces @code{libtasn1_perror()} in older libtasn1.
